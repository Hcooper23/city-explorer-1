# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

# Project Name - City-Explorer

**Author**: Michael Grant
**Version**: 1.0.0 (increment the patch/fix version number if you make more commits past your first submission)

## Overview
City Explorer will allow users to enter a location and view a map of the area.  When the user inputs the name of a location, the app will return the lat and long for the location.  The app then uses that data to retrieve a map of the location from a third-party API.  

## Getting Started
Clone the repository from GitHub onto your local machine.
Install the necessary dependencies using a package manager like npm or yarn.
Set up the API keys for the third-party API used to retrieve the location and map data.
Start the React application by running npm start in the terminal.
Open the application in your preferred web browser.
## Architecture
s application was built using React, a popular front-end JavaScript library. The components used in the application include App, Header, Main, LocationForm, LocationMap, and Footer.
